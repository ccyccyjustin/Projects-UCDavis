1. Analyzing Essays with Longformer

- We studied the theory behind Transformer models,
- and employed Longformer, which is able to handle long input sequences with its local attention mechanism,
- to predict writing components in essays, e.g. lead, claim, evidence and conclusion

2. Regime Trading with Wasserstein Metric

- We studied a variant of K-means clustering algorithm that uses the p-Wasserstein Metric,
- instead of the traditional euclidean norm, to predict market regime changes.
- We optimized the algorithm for general p >= 1, 
- and examined if this could generate profitable trading signal.
